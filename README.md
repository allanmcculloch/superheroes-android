# Superheroes Android

This is a simple app which displays a list of superheroes and some information about them. It uses the superhero api at superheroapi.com

1. Run the app - there are multiple problems. Please investigate and make the minimal fixes to make the app run. Hint: you may need an api key from superheroapi.com

2. Looking at the Main Activity - how can we improve this?

3. Please refactor the Main Activity to make the code more testable and maintainable

4. Please add a couple of tests to ensure Superheros are marked correctly as fast (when speed is over 50), strong (when power is over 55) and smart (when intelligence is over 60)

5. We want to mark a superhero as a [Fighter] when combat is over 30. Please add this functionality 

6. At the moment the superhero search is hard coded, please add a text field and button to allow us to search for different superhero 

7. Is there anything you would do to improve the design on a production app?

8. How would you handle failures (e.g. API errors)

9. Explain how you would add a details page to this app which shows all power stats for a particular superhero

10. Anything else you would do to make this app production ready?
